What is this baggotry?

This is a sort of catch-all bag utility addon that has no specific
functions yet, but is eventually intended to provide command-line and/or
scriptable interfaces for stuff like "split my yew timber into stacks of
10" or "collate all my loose stacks together".

This is mostly built to be a command line test harness for LibBaggotry.
